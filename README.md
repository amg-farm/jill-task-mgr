# jill-task-mgr
Basic Task Manager

Task: Create a web-based task manager
What Will the Application Do?
- The user can create a new task. Tasks consist of:
 - A task description
 -  The due date
 -  Whether itâ€™s complete or not
-  The user should see a list of all tasks
 - There should be a button or checkbox to mark the task complete
 - There should be a button to delete the task
- For MVP, you do not need to provide user authentication or state management--this can be
a single task list
