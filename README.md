# jill-task-mgr
Basic Task Manager

Task: Create a web-based task manager
What Will the Application Do?
● The user can create a new task. Tasks consist of:
o A task description
o The due date
o Whether it’s complete or not
● The user should see a list of all tasks
o There should be a button or checkbox to mark the task complete
o There should be a button to delete the task
● For MVP, you do not need to provide user authentication or state management--this can be
a single task list
